__WARNING:__
Very early development. It is very bugy and broken. Please don't download and complain that
it does not work. As of this writing this project is only about two weeks old.

# What is this?

A voxel engine written in TypeScript that uses Babylon.Js. 

# Why?

Divine Star has several other projects that need to use a voxel engine. So, I am making a 
public version of the engine for creators to use. It will not include things like world 
generation and so on. So you can fill out those things yourself. 

# Current Features

- Chunk based rendering and meshing
- Multi Threaded - World Gen and Chunk Creation happens in workers
- Ambient Occulsion - Nice shadows for the voxel 
- - Please thank this guy for it: https://twitter.com/iced_coffee_dev
- Infinite Generation
- Animated Textures
- Custom Shaders

# In Dev

- Greedy Meshing
- Different Block Types
- Saving Data

# Features Looking Ahead 

- Lighting System 
- Water Physics
- Entities
- Mob Starter Base
- Particles
